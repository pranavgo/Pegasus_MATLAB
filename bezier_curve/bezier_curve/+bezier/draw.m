function [vol, points, t] = draw(controlPts, varargin)
% DRAW draw a bezier curve onto a volume
%	vol = DRAW(controlPts) draw a bezier curve at on a volume. This first inerpolated the curve
%	at several points. The number of such points (nCurvePoints) interpolated is estimated by
%	computing the absolute distance of going through all the points in order, and multiplying
%	that distance by bezier.constants.pointsPerVoxelDist. The volume size is the smallest necessary to
%	encompas the curve.
%
%     Assumes isotropic space elements (e.g. isotropic pixel, voxel).
%
%     controlPts can also be a cell of bezier curves (cell of controlPts), in which case a cell of
%     volumes is returned.
%
%     controlPts is [nControlPts x nDims].
%     vol is the volume (of dimension nDims) in which the curve is drawn
%
%	vol = DRAW(controlPts, volSize) allows for the specification of the volume size. volSize must be
%   [1 x nDims]. If empty array ([]), the smallest volume size will be estimated.
%
%	vol = DRAW(controlPts, volSize, nCurvePoints) allows the specification of the number of
%	points to use for interpolation. nCurvePoints can be specified without volSize by setting
%	volSize to [].
%
%   [vol, points] = DRAW(...) also returns the interpolation points used to draw the curve.
%
%   [vol, points, t] = DRAW(...) also returns the interpolation points' parametrization along the
%   curve.
%
%   Note: the final values of the bezier image are approximated assuming enough nCurvePoints. If
%   something far more precise is needed with a small nCurvePoints, should consider interpolating
%   the given points more carefully.
%
%   Note: current drawing is limited to controlPts specifying points in an actual volume - that is,
%   they have to be > 0, and good drawing will only happen when the volume is large (i.e. not beween
%   1 and 2 or so, but more like 10s or 100s).
